## Security Note

Haddock passwords are a compromise between security and memorability. In terms
of offline cracking difficulty, they are less secure than a random character
sequence of the same length, as might be generated by a password manager. For
example, a 16-character Haddock password, if you know it's a Haddock password,
is about as hard to crack as 7 random characters.

Despite their weaknesses I believe Haddock passwords are still useful in some
scenarios, such as when using a password manager is impractical, or when you
*really* want to avoid ever storing a password anywhere except your own memory.
Just be aware of the trade-offs if you decide to use them.
